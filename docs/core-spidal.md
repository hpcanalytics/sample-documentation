# DA-MDS

Deterministic Annealing Multidimensional Scaling (DA-MDS) is a high performance
implementation of the [WDA-SMACOF](http://grids.ucs.indiana.edu/ptliupages/publications/WDA-SMACOF_v1.02.pdf)
algorithm.

## Success Stories

* Million Sequence Clustering at http://salsahpc.indiana.edu/millionseq/
* The Fungi Phylogenetic Project at http://salsafungiphy.blogspot.com/

## Prerequisites

1. Operating System
  * SPDIAL is extensively tested and known to work on,
    *  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.7 (Santiago)
    *  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.10 (Tikanga)
    *  Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS
    *  Ubuntu 12.10
  * This may work in Windows systems depending on the ability to setup OpenMPI properly, however, this has not been tested and we recommend choosing a Linux based operating system instead.

2. Java
  * Download Oracle JDK 8 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  * Extract the archive to a folder named `jdk1.8.0`
  * Set the following environment variables.
  ```
    JAVA_HOME=<path-to-jdk1.8.0-directory>
    PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export JAVA_HOME PATH
  ```
3. Apache Maven
  * Download latest Maven release from http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  * Extract it to some folder and set the following environment variables.
  ```
    MVN_HOME=<path-to-Maven-folder>
    $PATH=$MVN_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export MVN_HOME PATH
  ```

5. OpenMPI
  * We recommend using `OpenMPI 1.10.1` although it work with the previous 1.8 versions. Note, if using a version other than 1.10.1 please remember to set Maven dependency appropriately in the `pom.xml`.

  * Download OpenMPI 1.10.1 from http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.10/downloads/openmpi-1.10.1.tar.gz
  * Extract the archive to a folder named `openmpi-1.10.1`
  * Also create a directory named `build` in some location. We will use this to install OpenMPI
  * Set the following environment variables
  ```
    BUILD=<path-to-build-directory>
    OMPI_1101=<path-to-openmpi-1.10.1-directory>
    PATH=$BUILD/bin:$PATH
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BUILD/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export BUILD OMPI_1101 PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ```
  * The instructions to build OpenMPI depend on the platform. Therefore, we highly recommend looking into the `$OMPI_1101/INSTALL` file. Platform specific build files are available in `$OMPI_1101/contrib/platform` directory.
  * In general, please specify `--prefix=$BUILD` and `--enable-mpi-java` as arguments to `configure` script. If Infiniband is available (highly recommended) specify `--with-verbs=<path-to-verbs-installation>`. Usually, the path to verbs installation is `/usr`. In summary, the following commands will build OpenMPI for a Linux system.
  ```
    cd $OMPI_1101
    ./configure --prefix=$BUILD --enable-mpi-java
    make;make install
  ```
  * If everything goes well `mpirun --version` will show `mpirun (Open MPI) 1.10.1`. Execute the following command to instal `$OMPI_1101/ompi/mpi/java/java/mpi.jar` as a Maven artifact.
  ```
    mvn install:install-file -DcreateChecksum=true -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=$OMPI_1101/ompi/mpi/java/java/mpi.jar -DgroupId=ompi -DartifactId=ompijavabinding -Dversion=1.10.1
  ```
  * Few examples are available in `$OMPI_1101/examples`. Please use `mpijavac` with other parameters similar to `javac` command to compile OpenMPI Java programs. Once compiled `mpirun [options] java -cp <classpath> class-name arguments` command with proper values set as arguments will run the MPI Java program.

## Building DA-MDS

* Check all prerequisites are satisfied before building DA-MDS
* Clone this git repository from `git@github.com:DSC-SPIDAL/damds.git` Let's call this directory `damdshome`
* Once above two steps are completed, building DA-MDS requires only one command, `mvn install`, issued within `damdshome`.

Note : If you have not built https://github.com/DSC-SPIDAL/common library locally please follow the following instructions

Please follow the following instructions to build this project with maven
This is needed because of an SSL certificate issue with a dependency maven repo

execute the following commands from the root directory of the repo

```
keytool -import -file ./resources/ricecert/cs.rice.edu.cer -keystore /tmp/riceKeyStore
```

You can change the name of the key store and the path to it if you prefer to.
This command will first ask for a password, provide any password of your choosing with at least 6 characters
then it will show the following

```
Trust this certificate? [no]: 
```

type "y" and then press enter. Now the cert has been properly installed.
Next use the following command to compile the code

```
mvn -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/tmp/riceKeyStore clean install
```

## Running DA-MDS

The following shell script may be used with necessary modifications to run the program.
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Java classpath. This should include paths to damds dependent jar files and the damds-1.0.jar
# The dependent jar files may be obtained by running mvn dependency:build-classpath command within damdshome
cp=<classpath>

# Obtain working directory
wd=`pwd`
# Character x as a variable
x='x'

# A text file listing available nodes
hosts=<path-to-hostfile>
# Number of nodes
nodes=<num-nodes>
# Number of cores per node
cpn=8

# Options for Java runtime
jopts="-Xms64M -Xmx64M"

# Number of threads to use within one dapwc process
tpn=<threads-per-process>
# Number of processes per node
ppn=<processes-per-node>
# Total parallelism expressed as a pattern TxPxN
# where T is number of threads per process, P is processes per node, and N is total nodes
pat=$tpn$x$ppn$x$nodes

# Number of computing units assigned per process, assuming $cpn is divisible by $ppn
bw=$(($cpn/$ppn))

mmaps=1
# Directory to memory map. Ideally, set this to where tmpfs is in Linux
mmapdir=/dev/shm/$USER

echo "Running $pat on `date`" >> status.txt
# Invoke MPI to run dapwc
mpirun --report-bindings --mca btl ^tcp --hostfile $hostfile --map-by ppr:$ppn:node:PE=$bw --rank-by core -np $(($nodes*$ppn)) java $jopts -cp $cp edu.indiana.soic.spidal.damds.Program -c config$pat.properties -n $nodes -t $tpn -mmaps $mmaps -mmapdir $mmapdir | tee $pat/mds-out.txt
echo "Finished $pat on `date`" >> status.txt
```
The arguments listed in the `mpirun` command fall into three categories.
* OpenMPI Runtime Parameters
  * `--report-bindings` requests OpenMPI runtime to output how processes are mapped to processing elements (cores) in the allocated nodes.
  * `--mca btl ^tcp` instructs to disable tcp, which is useful when running on Infiniband.
  * `--hostfile` indicates the file listing available nodes. Each node has to be a in a separate line.
  * `--map-by ppr:$ppn:node:PE=$bw` controls process mapping and binding. This is a topic on its own right, but the specific values in this example requests processes to be mapped by node while binding each to `bw` number of processing elements. A good set of slides on this topic is available at http://www.slideshare.net/jsquyres/open-mpi-explorations-in-process-affinity-eurompi13-presentation
  * `-np $(($nodes*$ppn))` determines the total number of processes to run and in this case it is equal to `nodes*ppn`
* Java Runtime Parameters
  * `$jopts` in this case lists initial and maximum heap sizes for a JVM instance.
  * `-cp` indicates paths to find required classes where each entry is separated by a `:` (in Linux)
* Program (dapwc) Parameters
  * `-c` points to the configuration file. This is a Java properties files listing values for each parameter that damds requires. Details on these parameters will follow in a later section.
  * `-n` indicates the total number of nodes
  * `-t` denotes the number of threads to use within one instance of damds
  * `-mmaps` is the number of memory maps to use. Set this to 1 for the best performance
  * `-mmapdir` points to the directory where memory maps should be created. Ideally, it should point to `tmpfs` directory in Linux

## Configuring damds

The following table summarizes the parameters used in dapwc.

| Parameter | Description | Default Value | Type |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| DistanceMatrixFile | Path of the pairwise distance file. | n/a | String |
| WeightMatrixFile | Path of the pairwise weight matrix file or the simple linear weights text file. | n/a | String |
| LabelDataFile | Path of the points' labels file. | n/a | String |
| InitialPoints File | Path of the initial points file. | n/a | String |
| PointsFile | Path of the output points file. | n/a | String |
| TimingFile | Path of the output timing information. | n/a | String |
| SummaryFile | Path of the output summary file. | n/a | String |
| NumberDataPoints | Total number of data points. | n/a | Integer |
| TargetDimension  | Target dimension of the output points. | 3 | Integer |
| DistanceTransform | Raise distances to the power of DistanceTransform. | 1.0 | Double |
| Threshold  | Stress threshold. | 0.000001 | Double |
| Alpha | Cooling factor. | 0.95 | Double |
| TminFactor | The minimum temperature factor. | 0.5 | Double |
| StressIterations | The maximum number of stress loops to run. | 10000 | Integer |
| CGIterations | The maximum number of conjugate gradient loops | 20 | Integer |
| IsSammon | The flag to determine if sammon distances should be used | false | Boolean |
| BlockSize | The block size to use in block matrix multiplication | 64 | Integer |
| IsBigEndian | The flat to indicate the endianness of the binary distance file.  | false | Boolean |
| IsMemoryMapped | The flag to indicate if memory mapped files should be used to load data. | true | Boolean |
| TransformationFunction | The path of the jar file containing additional distance transformations. | null | String |
| WeightTransformationFunction | The path of the jar file containing additional weight transformations. | null | String |
| Repetitions | The number of repetitions (see below). | 1 | Integer |
| MaxTempLoops | The maximum number of temperature loops (see below). | 0 | Integer |
| IsSimpleWeights | The flag to indicate if weights are read from a simple linear file. | false | Boolean |

`Repetitions` is a quick way to test large data sizes using a smaller original
distances and weights files. For example with a NxN data set and a `Repetitions=2`,
DA-MDS will do a 2Nx2N run. It does so by tiling the NxN matrix 4 times
(2 horizontally and 2 vertically).

`MaxTempLoops` allows to test the program for performance without running for
full convergence by allowing it to run only the specified number of temperature loops.
Setting this to `0` will disable it and will do the full run.

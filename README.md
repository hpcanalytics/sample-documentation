# HPCAnalytics Documentation

This documentation is written using mark down files. These markdown files are converted into HTML and deployed on to github pages.

In order to write documentation one has to be knowledgeable about markdown files. 

Documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). Please refer its documentation on how to build.

## Deploying the documentation to website

The website created using markdown files are deployed onto Github pages. We use a custom URL for the website.

## Installing Docusaurus

## Writing Documentation

You can add your documentation to the docs folder as a markdown file. 

On top of the markdown file add a header like following to link the markdown file to other files and use it in the sidebar. The id is used to refer to the document in the sidebar.

```text
id: img_proc
title: Image Processing
```

Inside website folder there is a file called, sidebars.json. You can modify that file to include the documentation in the sidebar.
